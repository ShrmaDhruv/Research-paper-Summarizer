[TITLE] Abstract


[PLAIN_TEXT] Artificial neural networks have been extensively applied to document analysis and recognition. Most efforts have been devoted to the recognition of isolated handwritten and printed characters with widely recognized successful results. However, many other document processing tasks like pre-processing, layout analysis, character segmentation, word recognition, and signature verification have been effectively faced with very promising results. This paper surveys most significant problems in the area of off-line document image processing where connectionist-based approaches have been applied. Similarities and differences between approaches belonging to different categories are discussed. A particular emphasis is given on the crucial role of the prior knowledge for the conception of both appropriate architectures and learning algorithms. Finally, the paper provides a critical analysis on the reviewed approaches and depicts most promising research guidelines in the field. In particular, a second generation of connectionist-based models are foreseen which are based on appropriate graphical representations of the learning environment.
Index Terms: Character segmentation, document image analysis and recognition, layout analysis, neural networks, pre-processing, recursive neural networks, word recognition.
