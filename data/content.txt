Abstract. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function which was proposed in 2000 as a new generation of SHA functions and was adopted as FIPS standard in 2002. In this paper we will consider a SHA-256 variant and a SHACAL-2 variant in which every arithmetic addition is replaced by XOR operation. We call the SHA-256 variant SHA-2-XOR and the SHACAL-2 variant SHACAL-2-XOR respectively. We will present a differential attack on these constructions by using one-round iterative differential characteristics with probability 2~° we identified. Our result shows that SHACAL-2-XOR with up to 31 rounds out of 64 has a weakness of randomness and that SHA-2-XOR with up to 34 rounds has a weakness of pseudo-collision resistance. Using the 31-round distinguisher, we present an attack on SHACAL-2-XOR with up to 32 rounds. We also show that no 2-round iterative patterns with probability higher than 2~!° exist.
Keywords: SHA-256,SHA-2-XOR, SHACAL-2-XOR, Differential cryptanalysis, Pseudo-collision resistance, Iterative patterns.

[TITLE] 1 Introduction


[PLAIN_TEXT] A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes input strings of arbitrary (typically very large) length and maps these to short fixed length output strings. The progress in cryptanalysis of cryptographic hash functions has been quite slow until very recently, the cryptographic community has been surprised at the progress of cryptanalysis of hash functions, such as an attack on MD5 [23] for finding collisions and an attack with a new strategy on SHA-O [2,3] and an attack for finding multi-collisions. However, these techniques are not applicable to SHA-256 due to its more complex message schedule and round function.
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function which was proposed in 2000 as a new generation of SHA functions and was adopted as FIPS standard in 2002 [18]. SHA-256 is constructed from MD(Merkle-Damgard) -construction and DavisMeyer mode. The compression function of SHA-256 has 64 rounds, two kinds of
